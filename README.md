# wiki updater
 program that checks git log, and updates wiki



# USAGE

This will run forever on my raspberry pi at home, so no need to do anything on that front. \\
To use, make sure your commit messages are in the following form:
<task number>, <progress>, <message>
eg. 

`` 5, 10, implemented findAngle fn `` \\ or: \\
`` git commit -m " 4, 5, almost finished this function! ``
